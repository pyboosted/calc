# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Boosted Calculator is a powerful terminal-based calculator built with TypeScript and Ink (React for CLI). It features advanced mathematical operations, unit conversions, live currency conversion, string manipulation (v1.3.0), boolean operations (v1.3.1), arrays and objects (v1.3.2), and a sophisticated expression parser. The project uses Bun as the package manager and development runtime, but is distributed as a standard Node.js package.

# Linting and formatting
bun run lint        # Auto-fix linting issues
bun run format      # Format code
bun run check       # Run all checks (lint + format)

# Install globally
npm i -g .

# Publishing workflow
bun run typecheck && bun run lint && npm version patch && git push && npm publish
```

### Workflow Guidelines

**Before pushing code:**
1. Always run `bun run typecheck` to ensure no TypeScript errors
2. Always run `bun run lint` to fix linting issues
3. Always run `bun run format` to ensure consistent code style
4. Always run `bun test` to ensure all tests pass

**Before publishing to npm:**
1. Always run `bun run build` to ensure the dist/ folder is up to date
2. The `prepublishOnly` hook will automatically build, but manual verification is recommended

**Before committing:**
- Always ask for confirmation on the commit message before running `git commit`
- Show the proposed commit message and wait for approval
- This ensures commit messages are clear and follow project conventions

### Running Specific Tests
```bash
# Run a specific test file
bun test tests/evaluator.test.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern
bun test --name-pattern "percentage"
```

## Code Architecture

### Expression Processing Pipeline

1. **Tokenizer** (`src/parser/tokenizer.ts`): Converts raw input into tokens
   - Handles numbers, operators, units, functions, variables, keywords, strings, booleans, arrays, objects
   - String literals: backticks with interpolation, single/double quotes without
   - Recognizes multi-character operators and currency symbols
   - Recognizes comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
   - Tokenizes boolean/null keywords and logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
   - Tokenizes array literals (`[`, `]`) and object literals (`{`, `}`)
   - Maintains position information for each token
   - Processes escape sequences in strings

2. **Parser** (`src/parser/parser.ts`): Builds Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens
   - Recursive descent parser with proper operator precedence
   - Special handling for percentage operations in context (e.g., `100 - 10%` â†’ `100 - (100 * 10/100)`)
   - Converts unit syntax (`100 cm`) into binary operations
   - Handles "X% of Y" syntax separately from regular percentages
   - Parses string literals with interpolation expressions
   - Handles type casting syntax (`expression as type`)
   - Parses boolean literals (`true`, `false`, `null`)
   - Parses array literals (`[1, 2, 3]`) and object literals (`{a: 1, b: 2}`)
   - Supports property access (dot notation and bracket notation)
   - Implements comparison and logical operators with proper precedence
   - Supports ternary conditional operator (`? :`)

3. **Evaluator** (`src/evaluator/evaluate.ts`): Executes AST to produce results
   - Maintains variable state across evaluations
   - Handles unit conversions through `convertUnits`
   - Integrates with date/time operations via `date-manager`
   - Returns discriminated union `CalculatedValue` objects (number, string, date, boolean, null, array, or object)
   - Evaluates string interpolations and operations
   - Implements type casting between strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects
   - Evaluates array operations (push, pop, slice, etc.) and object operations (keys, values, has)
   - Handles property access for both arrays (index) and objects (key)
   - Evaluates comparison operations with automatic unit conversion
   - Implements short-circuit evaluation for logical operators
   - Uses JavaScript-like truthiness rules for conditional expressions

### UI Architecture (Ink/React)

The UI uses Ink (React for CLI) with a sophisticated state management system:

1. **State Management**:
   - **CalculatorStateManager** (`src/ui/calculator-state.ts`): The core UI state machine. An EventEmitter-based manager that handles the direct consequences of user input.
     - Manages text content, cursor position, text selection, and copy/paste state.
     - Handles all keyboard input and navigation logic (moving cursor, selecting text, etc.).
     - Emits 'stateChanged' events to synchronize the React UI with the internal state.
   - **CalculatorEngine** (`src/ui/calculator-engine.ts`): Manages the logical state of the calculator's lines and their evaluation.
     - Maintains an array of `LineState` objects, each containing the input text, its calculated result, and any variable assignments.
     - Handles the evaluation of individual lines and orchestrates re-evaluation of dependent lines when a variable changes.
   - **HotkeyManager** (`src/ui/hotkey-manager.ts`): A layer responsible for processing raw keyboard events.
     - Maps complex key combinations (e.g., Ctrl+C, Alt+Backspace) to specific methods on the `CalculatorStateManager`.
     - Decouples the key event parsing from the state management logic.

2. **React Components**:
   - **Calculator** (`src/ui/Calculator.tsx`): Main component
     - Creates and manages CalculatorStateManager instance
     - Mirrors state manager's state in React for rendering
     - Handles exit keys (Esc and Ctrl+C)
   - **InputWithResult** (`src/ui/InputWithResult.tsx`): Individual line component
     - Renders input with syntax highlighting
     - Shows results or errors aligned to the right
     - Displays variable assignments
   - **InputLine** (`src/ui/InputLine.tsx`): Text rendering with selection
     - Handles cursor display and text selection highlighting
     - Uses tokenizer for syntax highlighting
     - Supports Unicode and special character rendering

### Type System (v1.3.0, updated v1.3.1, extended v1.3.2)

**CalculatedValue** is now a discriminated union:
```typescript
type CalculatedValue = 
  | { type: 'number'; value: number; unit?: string }
  | { type: 'string'; value: string }
  | { type: 'date'; value: Date; timezone?: string }
  | { type: 'boolean'; value: boolean }
  | { type: 'null'; value: null }
  | { type: 'array'; elements: CalculatedValue[] }
  | { type: 'object'; properties: Map<string, CalculatedValue> };
```

This allows the calculator to handle multiple data types while maintaining type safety.

### String Processing (v1.3.0)

1. **String Literals**:
   - Backticks (`): Support interpolation with `${expression}` syntax
   - Single quotes ('): No interpolation, literal strings only
   - Double quotes ("): No interpolation, literal strings only

2. **String Operations**:
   - **Concatenation (+)**: Joins strings or converts and joins mixed types
   - **Repetition (*)**: `string * number` repeats the string
   - **Subtraction (-)**: Removes suffix if present

3. **String Functions** (`src/evaluator/string-functions.ts`):
   - `len(string)`: Returns length
   - `substr(string, start, length?)`: Extracts substring
   - `charat(string, index)`: Gets character at index
   - `trim(string)`: Removes whitespace
   - `format(date, pattern)`: Formats dates using patterns

4. **Type Casting**:
   - `as string`: Converts numbers/dates/booleans to strings
   - `as number`: Converts strings/booleans to numbers (with validation)
   - `as boolean`: Converts any type to boolean using truthiness rules

### Boolean Operations (v1.3.1)

1. **Boolean Literals**:
   - `true`, `false`: Boolean values
   - `null`: Null value

2. **Comparison Operators**:
   - `==`, `!=`: Equality and inequality
   - `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`: Relational comparisons
   - Supports comparing numbers, strings, dates, and booleans
   - Unit conversions are applied when comparing numbers with units

3. **Logical Operators**:
   - `and`: Logical AND with short-circuit evaluation
   - `or`: Logical OR with short-circuit evaluation
   - `not`: Logical NOT
   - Operators return the last evaluated value (not just true/false)

4. **Ternary Operator**:
   - `condition ? trueValue : falseValue`: Conditional expression
   - Supports nested ternary expressions
   - Evaluates condition for truthiness

5. **Truthiness Rules**:
   - `false`, `0`, `""` (empty string), and `null` are falsy
   - All other values are truthy (including empty arrays/objects if added later)
   - Dates are always truthy

6. **Operator Precedence** (lowest to highest):
   - Ternary (`? :`)
   - Logical OR (`or`)
   - Logical AND (`and`)
   - Comparison (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
   - Additive (`+`, `-`)
   - Multiplicative (`*`, `/`, `%`)
   - Unary (`-`, `+`, `not`)
   - Exponentiation (`^`)

### Arrays and Objects (v1.3.2)

1. **Array Literals**:
   - `[1, 2, 3]`: Create arrays with square brackets
   - Empty arrays: `[]`
   - Mixed types: `[1, "hello", true]`
   - Nested arrays: `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`

2. **Object Literals**:
   - `{a: 1, b: 2}`: Create objects with curly braces
   - Empty objects: `{}`
   - String keys: `{"name": "John", "age": 30}`
   - Mixed value types: `{x: 1, y: "hello", z: true}`
   - Nested objects: `{person: {name: "John", age: 30}}`

3. **Array Functions**:
   - `push(arr, value)`: Add element to end (mutates array), returns new length
   - `pop(arr)`: Remove last element (mutates array), returns removed element or null
   - Note: Arrays are deep-cloned during recalculation to prevent accumulation issues
   - `first(arr)`: Get first element
   - `last(arr)`: Get last element
   - `slice(arr, start, end?)`: Extract portion of array
   - `length(arr)`: Get array length
   - `sum(arr)`: Sum of numeric elements
   - `avg(arr)` or `average(arr)`: Average of numeric elements

4. **Object Functions**:
   - `keys(obj)`: Get array of object keys
   - `values(obj)`: Get array of object values
   - `has(obj, key)`: Check if object has key

5. **Property Access**:
   - Dot notation: `obj.property`, `arr.0`
   - Bracket notation: `obj["property"]`, `arr[0]`
   - Dynamic access: `obj[variable]`, `arr[index]`
   - Nested access: `obj.person.name`, `arr[0][1]`

6. **Type Casting**:
   - `as array`: Parse JSON array from string
   - `as object`: Parse JSON object from string
   - Arrays/objects to string: Converts to JSON representation

7. **Integration with Aggregates**:
   - `sum` and `avg`/`average` work as both:
     - Aggregate keywords (operate on previous results)
     - Functions (operate on array arguments)
   - Context-aware tokenization determines usage

### Key Systems

1. **Unit Conversion** (`src/evaluator/unit-converter.ts`)
   - Dimensional analysis for unit compatibility
   - Supports length, weight, temperature, time, volume, data units
   - Special handling for temperature conversions (not linear)
   - Uses decimal system for data units (1 GB = 1000 MB)

2. **Currency Manager** (`src/utils/currency-manager.ts`)
   - Fetches live rates from exchangerate-api.com
   - Caches rates for 24 hours in `~/.config/boomi/currency_cache.json`
   - Supports 300+ currencies
   - Auto-updates on startup if cache is stale

3. **Configuration** (`src/utils/config-manager.ts`)
   - YAML-based config at `~/.config/boomi/config.yaml`
   - Currently supports precision setting (decimal places)
   - Auto-creates config directory and file on first run

4. **Date/Time Operations** (`src/utils/date-manager.ts`)
   - Keywords: today, tomorrow, yesterday, now, weekdays
   - Arithmetic with units: days, weeks, months, years, hours, minutes, seconds
   - Uses date-fns for reliable date manipulation

### Build System

The project uses tsup to compile TypeScript/JSX to JavaScript:
- Configuration in `tsup.config.ts`
- Creates optimized bundles in `dist/`
- Adds Node.js shebang to CLI entry point
- The `prepublishOnly` hook ensures builds before npm publish

### Exit Handling

The app uses `exitOnCtrlC: false` in Ink render options and handles exit keys manually in Calculator component to ensure both Esc and Ctrl+C work properly on first press.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

The calculator supports advanced keyboard navigation and editing:
- **Navigation**: Arrow keys, Ctrl+A/E (line start/end), Alt+Left/Right (word navigation)
- **Selection**: Shift+Arrow keys, Shift+Ctrl+A/E, Shift+Alt+Left/Right
- **Editing**: Ctrl+K (delete to end), Ctrl+U (delete to start), Alt+Backspace/Delete (word deletion)
- **Clipboard**: Ctrl+C (copy), Ctrl+X (cut), Ctrl+V (paste)
- **Line Operations**: Ctrl+J (join lines), Alt+Up/Down (move lines)
- **History**: Up/Down arrows navigate through line history
- **File Operations**: Ctrl+S (save file)
- **Special**: Tab (focus result), Ctrl+L (clear screen)

## Testing Strategy

Tests use Bun's built-in test framework with `describe`, `test`, and `expect`:
- `tests/evaluator.test.ts`: Core calculation logic
- `tests/parser.test.ts`: AST generation and operator precedence
- `tests/unit-conversion.test.ts`: Unit conversion accuracy
- `tests/boolean-operations.test.ts`: Boolean logic, comparisons, and ternary operator

## Important Notes

- The calculator is published as `boosted-calc` on npm
- Configuration and cache files are stored in `~/.config/boomi/`
- The parser treats invalid expressions as comments for better UX
- Percentage calculations are context-aware (addition/subtraction vs standalone)
- Unit parsing is context-aware - single letters are treated as units only when they follow numbers (e.g., `10 m`, `5kg`) or conversion keywords (e.g., `to m`, `in kg`)
- Unicode variable names are supported, including Cyrillic (e.g., `Ñ†ÐµÐ½Ð° = 100`)
- Date arithmetic supports expressions like `variable * time_unit + date` (e.g., `test * 1 day + today`)
- When fixing TypeScript errors in tests, avoid using non-null assertions (!); use proper type guards instead
- Text selection is fully supported with Shift+Arrow keys and various editing operations
- Clipboard operations (copy/cut/paste) work with system clipboard
- Comments can be inline with `#` (e.g., `2 + 2 # basic math`)
- The tokenizer supports multi-word timezone recognition (e.g., "new york", "los angeles")
- String literals support three types: backticks with interpolation, single/double quotes without (v1.3.0)
- String operations maintain type safety through discriminated union CalculatedValue type
- Type casting with `as` keyword allows conversion between strings, numbers, and booleans
- String functions are case-sensitive and follow JavaScript conventions
- Escape sequences in strings support `\n`, `\t`, `\\`, and `\`` 
- Aggregate operations (`total`) concatenate strings when previous results contain strings
- Boolean operations use JavaScript-like truthiness rules (v1.3.1)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`) implement short-circuit evaluation
- Comparison operators automatically handle unit conversions for numbers with units
- The ternary operator (`? :`) supports nested expressions and evaluates conditions for truthiness
- `null` is a distinct type from `false` or `0`, following JavaScript semantics
- Arrays and objects are first-class types with full support for literals, functions, and property access (v1.3.2)
- Array functions `push` and `pop` mutate the array (like JavaScript) - push returns new length, pop returns removed element
- The `sum`, `avg`, and `average` functions can work as both aggregate keywords and array functions
- Type casting supports parsing JSON strings to arrays/objects with `as array` and `as object`
- Property access works with both dot notation and bracket notation for arrays and objects
